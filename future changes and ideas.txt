New/more expensive Kanji for goldfind runewords.
Splash for minions.
Right-click to add fakenote gold directly to character. NOT NEEDED - YEAH DONT DO THIS THANKS
Consumable maps and changes to the systems surrounding it.
GFU-Possible to put ES behind one of the defenses? DR% or MDR/DR, both might be OP, prob dll change or something 
GFU-An "in-between" map that comes between current content and maps to move map drops off of Nihl and provide some harder content that isn't just maps. Could obivouslly be a map drop from Nihl heh
GFU-Sa packs added toloot pool of mats in maps. I can balance
GFU-Not many or 0 unique packs in maps, intended?
GFU-Make every single summon do some sort of elemental damage so their damage doesn't roll over and summon builds could actually work. Look into phasing?
GFU-Mapling using 2x maple branch + eventual Sa 10pack drop + scroll 50 for -40 req level. Hopefully recipe is each, just use 'any' I guess... lol
GFU-dll edit for arrow quantity. Ikanreed did it one realm for us. I'm sure we can figure it out or ask him | https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=45056
GFU-some absorb added summons in some way. Either as a new stat or part of the different masteries. Capped at something reasonable. Stat would be cool, or like a summoners charm that had different stats that helped summons etc.

Next Season:
Add dmg fix
Add orb fix
Add reroll recipe for uber charm

Annhilation to some kind of damaging aura, like winter's fury but orangish and magic??
